        <h2>My thoughts on other photography websites:</h2>
        <p>
            The websites I looked at were very visually appealing. I liked how they positioned each image in the page
            and included the name of it below with an option to buy the photo.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something I didn't like were the colors they used. The websites looked very plain, but somehow the lack of
            colors really emphasized the beauty of the photos, so maybe they did that on purpose and it's something I'm
            considering.

        <h4>
            What types of content do competitors use on their websites?
        </h4>
        <p>
            They all display their photos, have a place where they can sell their photos, contact information for photo
            shoots
        </p>
        <h4>
            What types of images are used?
        </h4>
        <p>Other websites highlight what the owner likes to photograph. For example, one may display photos of nature
            while
            another only shows pictures of people.
        </p>
        <h4>
            What color schemes are used?
        </h4>
        <p>
            They use 3 colors. Usually whinte, black, and another color that contrasts their photos.

        </p>
        <h4>
            Layout styles and techniques used?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Other websites have drop down menus for different kinds of photos as well as an interactive map that
            displays where each photo was taken.
