            Where will you get all of the content for your site (ie. images & text)?
        </h4>

            If users want to photograph weddings, family portrates, or
            special events this website will give them all the information
            they need to book a high quality photographer.

            Why should a site be built for this?
        </h4>
        <p>
            Building a website for this would allow my mom easily share pictures, prices, and
            contact information about her business to potential clients.
        </p>
